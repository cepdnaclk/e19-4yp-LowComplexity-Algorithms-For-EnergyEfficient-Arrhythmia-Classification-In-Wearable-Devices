# Contains the code for normalization -> Beat-wise z-score normalization
# This method standardizes each individual beat by centering its values around zero and scaling them to have unit variance.
# For each beat (a vector of ECG samples), the mean value of that beat is subtracted from every sample, centering the beat's 
# data around zero. Then, the result is divided by the standard deviation of that beat, scaling the beatâ€™s amplitude so that 
# it has a standard deviation of one.

# ECG signals vary in amplitude due to patient differences, electrode placement, and noise. Normalization removes these variations
# so the model focuses on waveform shape rather than absolute voltage.
